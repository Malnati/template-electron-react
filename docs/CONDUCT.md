# Code Conduct for Electron-React Boilerplate Project

## Introduction

The Electron-React Boilerplate Project serves as a robust starting point for developers looking to build Electron-React applications with a standardized and streamlined setup. This Code Conduct outlines the guidelines and best practices that contributors should adhere to, ensuring the project maintains its quality, consistency, and ease of use.

## Guidelines

### Commit Messages

Crafting meaningful and standardized commit messages is crucial for maintaining a clean and understandable Git history. Please refer to [COMMIT.md](COMMIT.md) for guidelines on structuring your commit messages. This practice aligns with our goal of ensuring consistency and clarity in our version control history.

### Configuration Files

Configuration files like `.env`, `.gitconfig`, and `.editorConfig` are pivotal for customizing the development environment. For more details on these configurations, see [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md). This practice supports our aim of providing a standardized coding environment across different setups.

### Dependency Management

Managing dependencies in a way that retains the project's OS-agnostic nature is essential. For guidelines on dependency management, please refer to [DEPENDENCY.md](DEPENDENCY.md). This aligns with our objective of maintaining a project setup that is flexible across different operating systems.

### Error Handling

Effective error handling enhances the diagnostic process and overall project contribution experience. For guidelines on error handling, see [ERROR.md](ERROR.md). This practice ensures a user-friendly and developer-friendly experience within the project.

### Variable Naming

Consistent and descriptive variable naming significantly contributes to code readability and maintainability. For more details on variable naming conventions, see [VARIABLE.md](VARIABLE.md). This practice supports our goal of ensuring an efficient and versatile development process.

## Conclusion

By adhering to the guidelines outlined in this Code Conduct, contributors play a vital role in achieving the goals of the Electron-React Boilerplate Projectâ€”accelerating the setup process, ensuring a standardized development environment, and promoting a high level of code quality.
