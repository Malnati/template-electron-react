# Magic Link Login Feature

## Overview

This boilerplate introduces the Magic Link Login feature as its core user feature. Designed to streamline authentication, this approach simplifies the login process, enhancing both security and user experience.

## How It Works

1. **Email Submission**: Users start by entering their email into the login field of the desktop application.
2. **Magic Link Generation**: The system then generates a unique, secure token and embeds it within a magic link, which is sent to the user's email.
3. **One-Click Login**: Upon receiving the email, users can click the magic link, which automatically fills in the token field in the application and grants them access.

## Benefits

- **Security**: Each magic link is tokenized, creating a secure, one-time-use authentication method.
- **Convenience**: Eliminates the need to remember passwords.
- **Speed**: Users gain immediate access with just one click, reducing the time spent on the login process.

## Implementation

The feature is implemented in an Electron application, ensuring a seamless desktop experience. The boilerplate is configured to be easily integrated with your existing backend services to handle the email dispatch and token validation.
