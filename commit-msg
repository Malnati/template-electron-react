- The <TYPE>, then a (<SCOPE> <EMOJI>) between parenteses, then a double point ':', then a space and finally, the subject. \
  * Example as it is manually: git commit -m 'MINOR(üé® style): footer size increased'.  \
- The <TYPE> can be (MAJOR|MINOR|PATCH) following the Semantic Versioning Specification (SemVer). \
  1) MAJOR version when the changes are incompatible API changes. \
  2) MINOR version when adding functionality in a backward compatible manner. \
  3) PATCH version when making backward compatible bug fixes. \
- The <SCOPE> must including a name listed here, followed an <EMOJI>, arrounded by parenteses. Example (fix üêõ): \
  SCOPE list: core üß±, elements üîç, http üåê, language-service üà≥, platform-browser üåç, platform-browserdynamic üåé, platform-server üñ•Ô∏è, platform-webworker üë∑, platform-webworker-dynamic, router üß≠, service-worker üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, upgrade ‚¨ÜÔ∏è. \
